#### Are you sure you're paying the right price for you house?

Unless you are a real-estate guru, purchasing your first home, or even selling one is a very painful experience. There may be several features that you appreciate which may or may not align with the features which the seller appreciates, and closing prices are often met somewhere in the middle. However, how do you know that you are paying or receiving the “Fair” market value of the property of interest? How do you even set a “starting point” for your dream purchase or sale? Our goal is to assist those who are in need of such “starting point” by providing them the estimated “market” value of the property of interest via leveraging data and machine learning.

We've implmented six different regression models, and Support Vector Regressor resulted in the highest R-squared (0.733). Moreover, among many features of a house, we found that the nubmer of bathrooms and the number of bedrooms influence a house's price the most.
