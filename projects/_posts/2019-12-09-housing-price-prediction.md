#### Are you sure you're paying the right price?

Unless you are a real-estate guru, purchasing your first home, or even selling one is a very painful experience. Unlike everyday grocery shopping, “house shopping” does not occur as often so that “learning from past experience” does not work. If you are purchasing your home, there are several features that you appreciate which may or may not align with the features which the seller appreciates and closing prices are often met somewhere in the middle. However, how do you know that you are paying or receiving the “Fair” market value of the property of interest? How do you even set a “starting point” for your dream purchase or sale? You might have a friend who recently purchased his/her home or a broker working for you to tell you that number based on their recent experience or even from haunch. Our goal is to assist those who are in need of such “starting point” by providing them the estimated “market” value of the property of interest via leveraging data and machine.
