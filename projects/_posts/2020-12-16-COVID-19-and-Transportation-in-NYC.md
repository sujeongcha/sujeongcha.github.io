Since the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in New York City, people have been advised to keep social-distancing and avoid public transportation, which results in a steep change in the mobility patterns. This project investigates the level of impacts that COVID-19 has had on four means of transportation in NYC, including subway, taxi, for-hire vehicles (FHV, e.g. Uber/Lyft), and Citi Bike. 

In order to tackle this problem, we suggest two approaches: 1) analyze cross-correlation between COVID-19 and the ridership and 2) build a pre-COVID model to predict ridership during the post-COVID era to see the differences. The results from both approaches are consistent, demonstrating that all of the transportations have been affected by COVID-19. According to our findings, the FHV usage pattern has changed the most drastically and Citi Bike ridership has been the least affected by the pandemic.
